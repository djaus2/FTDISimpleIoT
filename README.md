# FTDISimpleIoT

A stripped down version of FTDISample (https://github.com/Jark/FTDISample) to examine an issue tha thas arisen when used with a Startup Task (Headless). Issue see (https://github.com/Jark/FTDISample/issues/4#issuecomment-145351461)

Contains two projects:
* A Universal Windows App
* A Startup Task (Headless)

Both use the same code to interact with the FTDI D2XX driver
