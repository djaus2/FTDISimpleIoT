# FTDISimpleIoT

A stripped down version of FTDISample (https://github.com/Jark/FTDISample) to examine an issue tha thas arisen when used with a Startup Task (Headless). 

Contains two projects:
* A Universal Windows App
* A Startup Tak (Headless)

Both use the same code to interact with eth FTDI D2XX driver
